## Idea

### Short description:

Saving frequently used text fragments for future reuse.

### Description:

While browsing internet often needed to input same text over and over. Like search clauses, inputs, form fills, comments and messages. Sometimes solved by resorting to create text files with reused text, this could be inconvenient.
This extension is aim to solve this problem by providing user friendly system for managing reusable texts directly in browser.
